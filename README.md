# Identification of Software Bugs Using SMLT Random Forest Algorithm

This project focuses on identifying software bugs using machine learning algorithms. The performance of the **SMLT Random Forest** model is compared with other popular classifiers including Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Software bugs can severely impact software performance and reliability. This project aims to develop an efficient bug prediction model using supervised machine learning techniques to improve software quality and reduce maintenance costs.
